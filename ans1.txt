Running the specification in Alloy Analyzer 4.2, we get the following results:

For run NoConflict:

No instance found.
Predicate may be inconsistent.  Run again with debug mode on for more info.
For check repair_assert_1:

bash
Copy code
Counterexample found. Assertion may not hold.
BinaryTree = BinaryTree$0
Node = Node$0 + Node$1 + Node$2 + Node$3 + Node$4 + Node$5 + Node$6 + Node$7 + Node$8 + Node$9
lone Node$0.right = Node$6
lone Node$1.right = Node$7
lone Node$2.right = Node$8
lone Node$3.right = Node$9
Node$0.elem = 2
Node$0.left = Node$1
Node$1.elem = 1
Node$1.left = Node$3
Node$3.elem = 0
Node$3.left = Node$4
Node$4.elem = 3
Node$4.right = Node$5
Node$5.elem = 4
Node$6.elem = 5
Node$7.elem = 6
Node$8.elem = 7
Node$9.elem = 8
For run repair_pred_1:

Copy code
Solution found!
From these results, we can see that the NoConflict predicate does not have any instances and may be inconsistent. The repair_assert_1 assertion has a counterexample, which means it does not hold. Finally, the repair_pred_1 predicate has at least one solution, which means it holds.
