The bug in this specification is in the 'AllExtObject' predicate. The formula in the predicate should state that each subclass of Object should be in Object's transitive closure of non-extension. To fix this, we can replace "c in c.*ext" with "c in Object.^~ext". 

The corrected 'AllExtObject' predicate is as follows:

pred AllExtObject() {
  // Each class other than Object is a sub-class of Object.
  all c: Class - Object | c in Object.^~ext
}
