The bug is in the Sorted predicate where it states "n.elem < n.nxt.elem". This condition only checks that the current element is less than the next element but does not handle the case where there is no next element (i.e., the last element). This can cause an error when checking sortedness. To fix this, we need to change the condition to "some n.nxt => n.elem <= n.nxt.elem". The updated predicate would be as follows:

// Part (c)
pred Sorted() {
  // The list is sorted in ascending order (<=) along nxt.
  all n: Node {
    some n.nxt => n.elem <= n.nxt.elem
  }
}
