The bug in the specification is in the predicate "Sorted". It currently enforces that every node's element is less than or equal to the element of its linked node, but this is overconstraining because it disallows cycles in the list. To fix this, we should replace "n.elem <= n.^link.elem" with "some n.link => n.elem <= n.link.elem".

The corrected predicate "Sorted" looks like this:

pred Sorted(This: List) {
    all n: This.header.*link | some n.link => n.elem <= n.link.elem
}
