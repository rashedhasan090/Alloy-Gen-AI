The bug in this specification is in the following line of the InBound predicate: 

Array.length = #Element 

This line is assuming that there are no missing or duplicate elements in the array, and that the number of elements is equal to the length of the array. However, this assumption may not always hold true, as there could be missing or duplicate elements in the array.

The fix to this bug is to replace the above line with:

Array.length >= 0 

This ensures that the length of the array is non-negative and doesn't make any assumptions about the number of elements in the array.
