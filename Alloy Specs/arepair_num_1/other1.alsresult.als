The bug in the specification is in the fact block where it states "alas in seclab.located_in and peds in seclab.located_in". This implies that both alas and peds must be in located_in for seclab, however, they could be in separate locations. The fix is to replace it with "alas + peds = seclab.located_in" which ensures that only alas and peds are in located_in for seclab.

The corrected Alloy specification is:

//people
sig Person {
   member_of : some Group
}

pred CanEnter(p: Person, r:Room) {
    p.member_of in r.located_in
}

// groups 
sig Group {}
one sig alas extends Group {}  
one sig peds extends Group {}

//rooms
sig Room {
  located_in: set Group
}
one sig seclab extends Room {}

fact {
  alas + peds = seclab.located_in
}

// assertion
assert repair_assert_1 {
   all p : Person | CanEnter[p, seclab] implies alas in p.member_of or peds in p.member_of
}
check repair_assert_1

pred repair_pred_1{
   all p : Person | CanEnter[p, seclab] implies alas in p.member_of or peds in p.member_of
}
run repair_pred_1
