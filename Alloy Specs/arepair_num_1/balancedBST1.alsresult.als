The bug in the specification is in the Depth function. The "^~(left + right)" operator is used instead of "*~(left + right)", which means that the Depth function returns the total number of nodes in the tree instead of the number of nodes from the root to n.

To fix the bug, we need to replace "^~(left + right)" with "*~(left + right)". The corrected function should look like this:

fun Depth(n: Node): one Int {
  // The number of nodes from the tree's root to n.
  -- TODO: Your code starts here.
  #(n.*~(left + right))
}

The check and run commands at the end of the specification are not related to the bug and do not need to be modified.
