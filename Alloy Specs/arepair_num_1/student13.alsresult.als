The bug in the specification is in the predicate "Loop". In the line "no This.header || one n:This.header.*link | n.link in n", the operator "in" should be replaced with "=", as it is comparing nodes instead of referring to the same node.

The corrected predicate "Loop" is as follows:

```
pred Loop (This : List){
    no This.header || one n:This.header.*link | n = n.link
}
```
