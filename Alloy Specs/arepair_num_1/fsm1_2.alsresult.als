The bug in the specification is in Part (b), where "s.transition !in FSM.start" should be replaced with "FSM.start !in s.transition". Additionally, the implication in the second assertion should be replaced with an equivalence. The fixed specification is as follows:

one sig FSM {
  start: set State,
  stop: set State
}

sig State {
  transition: set State
}

// Part (a)
fact OneStartAndStop {
  // FSM only has one start state.
  one FSM.start

  // FSM only has one stop state.
  one FSM.stop

  // There is always a stop state.
  some FSM.stop
}

// Part (b)
fact ValidStartAndStop {
  // A state cannot be both a start state and a stop state.
  FSM.start !in FSM.stop

  // No transition ends at the start state.
  all s: State | FSM.start !in s.transition

  // If no transition, then the state is a stop state.
  all s: State | s.transition = none <=> s in FSM.stop
}

// Part (c)
fact Reachability {
  // All states are reachable from the start state.
  State = FSM.start.*transition

  // The stop state is reachable from any state.
  all s: State | FSM.stop in s.*transition
}

//run {} for 5

assert repair_assert_1{
    no FSM.stop.transition
}

check repair_assert_1

pred repair_pred_1{
    no FSM.stop.transition
}

run repair_pred_1
