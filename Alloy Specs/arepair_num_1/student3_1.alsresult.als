The bug in the specification is in the Loop predicate. 

The original Loop predicate includes the condition "no n: Node | n = (n - This.header).link && one n:Node | n.link = This.header". This condition is over-constraining because it disallows the possibility of a node being its own link (which would create a loop in the list). 

To fix this, the "&&" in the condition should be replaced with "||", and the first part of the condition should be changed to "no This.header". This would allow for the possibility of a node being its own link, while still ensuring that the list doesn't have any external loops.

The fixed Loop predicate should be: 

pred Loop(This: List) {
    no This.header |
    one n: This.header.*link | n = n.link
}

Note that the Fixed Sorted predicate was also incorrect in the original specification. To fix it, "n.elem <= (n.link-This.header).elem" should be replaced with "some n.link => n.elem <= n.link.elem". This ensures that any consecutive nodes in the list are sorted in increasing order of their elem values.
