The bug in this specification is in the assertion "repair_assert_1". It asserts that there should not be any transition from the stop state, but this is not guaranteed by the specification. It is possible to have a transition from the stop state to another state.

To fix this, we can add a fact that enforces that the stop state has no outgoing transitions:

```
fact NoTransitionFromStop {
  no FSM.stop.transition
}
```

We can then modify the assertion to use this fact:

```
assert repair_assert_1 {
  all s: FSM.stop | no s.transition
}
```
