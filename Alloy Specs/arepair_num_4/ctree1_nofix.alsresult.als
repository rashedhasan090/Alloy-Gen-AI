The bug in this specification is that it does not constrain the colors of adjacent nodes to be different. To fix this, we need to add a constraint that says that the color of any adjacent nodes must be different. 

Here's the corrected specification: 

abstract sig Color {}
one sig Red extends Color {}
one sig Blue extends Color {}

sig Node {
  neighbors: set Node,
  color: one Color 
}

fact undirected {
  neighbors = ~neighbors   -- symmetric

  no iden & neighbors      -- antireflexive
}

fact graphIsConnected {
  all n1: Node | all n2: Node-n1 | 
    n1 in n2.^neighbors 
}

fact treeAcyclic {
  all n1, n2: Node | n1 in n2.neighbors implies 
    n1 not in n2.^(neighbors-(n2->n1)) 
}

fact noSameColorAdjacent {
  all n1, n2: Node | n1 in n2.neighbors implies 
    n1.color != n2.color
}

run {} for 3 Node

assert repair_assert_1{
    no iden & neighbors
}
check repair_assert_1

pred repair_pred_1{
    no iden & neighbors
}
run repair_pred_1
