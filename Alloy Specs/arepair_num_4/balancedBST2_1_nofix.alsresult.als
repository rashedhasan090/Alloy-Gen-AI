The bug in this specification is in the `fact Reachable`. The correct fact should be:

```
fact Reachable {
  Node = BinaryTree.root.*(left + right) + BinaryTree.root
}
```

This adds the root node to the set of reachable nodes, since the root is not included in the set of nodes reachable via left or right subtrees.
