The bug in the specification is in Part (c) of the Sorted predicate. The comparison operator should be <= instead of < to ensure that elements can be equal and still be considered sorted. The corrected Sorted predicate is:

pred Sorted() {
  // The list is sorted in ascending order (<=) along nxt.
  all n: Node {
    n.elem <= n.nxt.elem
  }
}
