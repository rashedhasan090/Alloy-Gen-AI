The bug is in the `Sorted` predicate, which does not handle the case where a node in the list does not have a `link` (i.e., it is the last node in the list). 

Here is the fixed `Sorted` predicate:

```
pred Sorted ( This : List ) {
    all n: This.header.*link |
        no n.link or n.elem <= n.link.elem
}
```

The fix ensures that all nodes in the list are either not linked to any other nodes, or their element is less than or equal to the element of the node they link to.
