The bug in this specification is in the fact "IGNORE". It states that "header" of "List" should be linked to all "Node" objects, which is incorrect. This can cause a violation of the "lone l.header" constraint in the "CardinalityConstraints" fact.

The fix is to remove the line "List.header.*link = Node" from the fact "IGNORE". The correct version of the fact is:

fact IGNORE {
  one List
}
