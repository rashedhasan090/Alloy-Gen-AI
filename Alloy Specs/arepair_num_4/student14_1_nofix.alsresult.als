The bug in this specification is the fact that the predicate "Sorted" is overconstraining the model. Specifically, the line "all n: This.header.*link | n.elem < n.link.elem" is checking that every node's element is less than its linked node's element, which is not necessary for a list. A list can have nodes with equal elements.
To fix this, we can change the predicate "Sorted" to only enforce that each node's element is less than or equal to its linked node's element: 

```
// Corrected predicate
pred Sorted(This: List){
    all n: This.header.*link | n.elem <= n.link.elem
}
``` 
By making this change, we allow for lists that have nodes with equal elements, while still enforcing the property that the list is sorted in non-descending order.
