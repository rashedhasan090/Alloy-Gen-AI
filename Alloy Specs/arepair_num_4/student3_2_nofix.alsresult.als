The bug in the specification is in the predicate `Sorted`. The correct implementation of the predicate should be:

```
pred Sorted(This: List) {
    all n: Node | n in This.header.*link => (no m: n.link | m.elem < n.elem)
}
```

The original implementation incorrectly subtracted the header node from the set of linked nodes (`n.link - This.header`), which resulted in a type error. The corrected implementation ensures that each node in the list is greater than or equal to its predecessor by checking that no linked node has a smaller element value.
