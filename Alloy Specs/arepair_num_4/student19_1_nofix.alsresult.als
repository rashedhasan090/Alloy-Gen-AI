The bug in this specification is in the pred Sorted(This: List) since it requires that all nodes in the list have a link to a node with a smaller elem value. However, this assumes that the list is non-empty and ignores the possibility of having a list with only a single node. 

To fix this, we can modify the pred Sorted(This: List) as follows:

```
pred Sorted(This: List) {
    all n:This.header.*link | lone n.link implies n.elem < n.link.elem
}
```

This new version of Sorted allows for nodes without links, and correctly handles the case where the list contains only a single node.
