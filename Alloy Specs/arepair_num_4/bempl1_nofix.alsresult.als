The bug in this specification is that any person who owns a key to the secure_lab can enter it, regardless of whether they are a researcher or not. The specification should restrict access to only researchers who own a key to the secure_lab. 

To fix this issue, we need to modify the CanEnter predicate as follows: 

```
pred CanEnter(p: Person, r:Room) {
    r in p.owns.opened_by and p in Researcher
}
```

This predicate now checks that the person owns a key to the room and is also a researcher before granting them access. With this fix in place, the repair_assert_1 assertion will correctly ensure that only researchers can enter the secure lab, and the repair_pred_1 predicate will generate instances of the model that satisfy this new property.
