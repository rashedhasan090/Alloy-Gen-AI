The bug in this specification is in the fact named `Acyclic`. The line `lone n.~(left + right)` should be replaced with `lone n.(left + right)`. This is because the `~` operator in Alloy denotes the symmetric closure, which includes both the original relation and its inverse. In this case, `n.~(left + right)` includes both the left and right child relations, as well as the parents of `n` (i.e. the nodes with `n` as either their left or right child). This makes the fact incorrect, as it allows a node to have multiple parents. Replacing the `~` operator with `+` ensures that only the left and right child relations are included, as intended. 

The corrected fact is: 

```
fact Acyclic {
  all n : Node {
    // There are no directed cycles, i.e., a node is not reachable
    // from itself along one or more traversals of left or right.
    n !in n.^left + n.^right
    // A node cannot have more than one parent.
    lone n.(left + right)
    // A node cannot have another node as both its left child and
    // right child.
    no n.(left) & n.(right)
  }
}
```
