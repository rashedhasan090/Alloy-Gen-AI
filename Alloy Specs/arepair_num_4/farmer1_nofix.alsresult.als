The bug in this specification is in the crossRiver predicate. The eating constraints are incorrectly defined for when the Farmer is moving objects from the near side to the far side. This can potentially allow the Farmer to leave the Fox alone with the Chicken, resulting in the Fox eating the Chicken. 

To fix the bug, we need to update the eating constraints for when the Farmer is moving objects from the near side to the far side. We need to subtract the eaten object from the near side instead of the far side. 

Here's the updated crossRiver predicate: 

```
pred crossRiver [from, from', to, to': set Object] {
  // either the Farmer takes no items
  ( from' = from - Farmer &&
    to' = to - to.eats + Farmer ) ||
  // or the Farmer takes one item
  (some item: from - Farmer {
    from' = from - Farmer - item
    to' = to - item - item.eats + Farmer
  })
}
```

The updated constraints subtract the eaten object from the near side (i.e., `- item - item.eats`) and add it to the far side. 

With this fix, the Farmer cannot leave the Fox alone with the Chicken, and the puzzle can be solved correctly.
