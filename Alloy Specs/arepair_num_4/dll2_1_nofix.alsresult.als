The bug in this specification is in the Sorted predicate, which incorrectly assumes that every node has a non-null next element. This will cause an error when attempting to access the `elem` attribute of a node's non-existent next element. We can fix this by adding a condition to ensure that every node has a non-null next element before comparing `elem` values:

```
pred Sorted() {
  // The list is sorted in ascending order (<=) along nxt.
  all n: Node | n.nxt != none && n.elem < n.nxt.elem
}
```
