The bug in this specification is in the "assert repair_assert_1" section. This assertion is trying to check that none of the states in the FSM have a transition that goes back to the start state. However, the assertion is written incorrectly, and will always be satisfied regardless of whether or not there is a state that violates this condition.

To fix this, we need to change the assertion to check for the opposite condition. That is, we need to check that there exists at least one state in the FSM that has a transition that goes back to the start state. Here is the corrected assertion:

assert repair_assert_1{
  some s: State | FSM.start in s.transition
}

With this fix, the assertion will fail if there is a state in the FSM that violates this condition, and pass otherwise.
