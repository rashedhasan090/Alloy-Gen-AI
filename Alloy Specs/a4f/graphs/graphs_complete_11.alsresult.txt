The bug is in the predicate complete, where the check for completeness should be a check for each node being connected to every other node, instead of checking for Node being in n.adj. The fixed code for the complete predicate is:

/* The graph is complete, ie, every node is connected to every other node.

pred complete {
   all n1, n2: Node | n1 != n2 => n2 in n1.*(adj)
}
