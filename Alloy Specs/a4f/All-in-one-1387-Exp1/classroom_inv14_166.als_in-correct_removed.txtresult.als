The bug is in the predicate inv14. The line is commented out and needs to be fixed. Here's the fixed code:

/* Every student in a class is at least tutored by all the teachers
   * assigned to that class. */
pred inv14 {
  all s : Person, c : Class | (c.Groups).s -> Tutors & Teacher.Teaches.c implies s in Tutors
}
