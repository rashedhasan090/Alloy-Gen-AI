The bug in the specification is in the predicate inv6. The commented out constraint `~link . link in iden` is incorrect because it allows a file to have no links at all, which violates the requirement that a file must link to at most one other file. The fixed predicate inv6 is as follows:

```
/* A file links to at most one file. */
pred inv6 {
    all f: File | lone f.link
}
```
