The bug in this specification is a missing closing brace } in the predicate inv7. The corrected code is as follows:

/* There is no deleted link. */
pred inv7 {
  no link.Trash --correct
}

/* There are no links. */
pred inv8 {
  no link --correct
}

The corrected code includes the closing brace } for the predicate inv7.
