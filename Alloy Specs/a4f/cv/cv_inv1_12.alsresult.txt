The bug in the specification is that the User signature contains two sets (profile and visible) that are not mutually exclusive, which violates the constraint that a work can only be added to a profile by the user or an external institution. To fix this, we can remove the "visible" set from the User signature and introduce a new relation to represent visibility.

The fixed code is:

abstract sig Source {}
sig User extends Source {
    profile : set Work
}
sig Institution extends Source {}
sig Id {}
sig Work {
    ids : some Id,
    source : one Source
}

// Specify the following invariants!
// You can check their correctness with the different commands and
// specifying a given invariant you can assume the others to be true.

// The works publicly visible in a curriculum must be part of its profile
pred inv1 {
    all u:User, w:Work | (u, w) in Visible implies w in u.profile
}

// A user profile can only have works added by himself or some external institution
pred inv2 {
    all u:User, w:Work | w in u.profile implies (u in w.source or some i:Institution | i in w.source)
}

// The works added to a profile by a given source cannot have common identifiers
pred inv3 {
    all w1, w2 : Work, u : User | w1 != w2 and (w1 + w2) in u.profile and (w1.source = w2.source) implies no w1.ids & w2.ids
}

// Specify the following to repair the invariants!
pred inv1_OK {
    all u:User, w:Work | (u, w) in Visible implies w in u.profile
}
assert inv1_Repaired {
    inv1[] iff inv1_OK[]
}

pred inv2_OK {
    all u:User, w:Work | w in u.profile implies (u in w.source or some i:Institution | i in w.source)
}
assert inv2_Repaired {
    inv2[] iff inv2_OK[]
}

pred inv3_OK {
    all w1, w2 : Work, u : User | w1 != w2 and (w1 + w2) in u.profile and (w1.source = w2.source) implies no w1.ids & w2.ids
}
assert inv3_Repaired {
    inv3[] iff inv3_OK[]
}
