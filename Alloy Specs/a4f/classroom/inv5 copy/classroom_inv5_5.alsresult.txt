The bug is in the inv5 predicate. It currently expects there to be some classes assigned to teachers, but the specification does not ensure that. Therefore, we need to change it to allow for the possibility that there are no teachers assigned to any classes. 

Fixed code:
```
/* There are some classes assigned to teachers. */
pred inv5 {
  some Teacher.Teaches -> Class
}
``` 

Check and run commands:
```
check inv1_Repaired expect 0
check inv2_Repaired expect 0
check inv3_Repaired expect 0
check inv4_Repaired expect 0
check inv5_Repaired expect 0
check inv6_Repaired expect 0
check inv7_Repaired expect 0
check inv8_Repaired expect 0
check inv9_Repaired expect 0
check inv10_Repaired expect 0
check inv11_Repaired expect 0
check inv12_Repaired expect 0
check inv13_Repaired expect 0
check inv14_Repaired expect 0
check inv15_Repaired expect 0
```
