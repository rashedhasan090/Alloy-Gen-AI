The bug in the specification is in the predicate inv5. The comment suggests that there should be some classes assigned to teachers, but the actual predicate only checks if there are some teachers who teach at least one class. To fix this, we need to change the predicate to check for classes assigned to teachers.

Fixed code:

```
/* There are some classes assigned to teachers. */
pred inv5 {
    some c:Class | some t:Teacher | c in t.Teaches
}
```
