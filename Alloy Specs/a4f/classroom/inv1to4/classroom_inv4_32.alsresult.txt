There is a comment indicating a bug in the inv4 predicate. The commented line should be corrected by replacing "Student + Teacher" with "Person". Here is the fixed code:

/* No person is neither a student nor a teacher. */
pred inv4 {
  Person in (Student + Teacher)
}

The rest of the code remains unchanged.
