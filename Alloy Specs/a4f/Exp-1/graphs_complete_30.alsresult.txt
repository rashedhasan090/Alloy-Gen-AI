The bug is in the "complete" predicate. The correct code is:

pred complete {
    all n1,n2:Node | n1 != n2 => n2 in n1.adj
}

Explanation:
The "complete" predicate checks if every node is connected to every other node. The original code used the expression "Node in n.adj" inside the universal quantification, which is incorrect. The corrected code uses two distinct nodes (n1 and n2) and checks if n2 is in n1's adjacency set, which correctly captures the completeness property of the graph.
