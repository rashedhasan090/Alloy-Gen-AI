The bug in the specification is that the sig Class should have a relation Teaches : set Teacher instead of Teaches : set Class. Here is the corrected version of the specification:

sig Person {
    Tutors : set Person,
    Teaches : set Class
}

sig Group {}

sig Class {
    Groups : Person -> Group,
    Teaches : set Teacher
}

sig Teacher extends Person {}

sig Student extends Person
