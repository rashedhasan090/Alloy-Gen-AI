The bug in this specification is in the `inv4` predicate. The correct version is as follows:

pred inv4 {
    all s : State | some Init.*(s.trans)
}

Note that the commented out code is incorrect and has been removed. The corrected version simply checks that for each state s, there exists a path of transitions from an initial state to s.
