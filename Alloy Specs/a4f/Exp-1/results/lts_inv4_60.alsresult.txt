A possible fixed version of the Alloy specification is:

// A labeled transition system (LTS) is comprised of States, a sub-set
// of which are Initial, connected by transitions, here represented by 
// Events.
sig State {
    trans : Event -> State
}
sig Init in State {}
sig Event {}

// The LTS does not contain deadlocks, i.e., each state has at least a transition.
pred inv1 {
  all s: State | some s.trans
}

// There is a single initial state.
pred inv2 {
  one Init
}

// The LTS is deterministic, i.e., each state has at most a transition for each event.
pred inv3 {
  all s : State, e : Event | lone e.(s.trans)
}

// All states are reachable from an initial state.
// The definition below is equivalent to:
//   all s: State | some (Init.*(trans)) & s
// but uses an implicit quantification instead of a let expression.
pred inv4 {
  no s: State | (s !in Init.*(trans))
}

// All the states have the same events available.
pred inv5 {
  all s1,s2: State | s1.trans.Event = s2.trans.Event
}

// Each event is available in at least one state.
pred inv6 {
  all e:Event | some s:State | e in s.trans.Event
}

// The LTS is reversible, i.e., from a reachable state it is always
// possible to return to an initial state.
pred inv7 {
  all s : Init.*(trans) | some i : Init | i in s.*(~trans)
}

// Check that each predicate is true (0 = success).
check inv1, inv2, inv3, inv4, inv5, inv6, inv7 expect 0

// Repair any violation of predicate inv4 (if any).
pred repair_pred_1 {
  inv4[] iff (let tr = { s1, s2 : State, e : Event | s1->e->s2 in trans } |
               State in Init.*(tr))
}
run repair_pred_1
assert repair_assert_1 {
  inv4[] iff (let tr = { s1, s2 : State, e : Event | s1->e->s2 in trans } |
              State in Init.*(tr))
}
