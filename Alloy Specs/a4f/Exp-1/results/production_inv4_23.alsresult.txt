The bug in the specification is in inv4 predicate. The correct version is:

pred inv4 { // The parts required by a component cannot be assembled in a later position
    all c:Component, p:c.parts | p.cposition in c.cposition.*next
}

The corrected code includes replacing ".nexts" with ".*next" in the inv4 predicate.
