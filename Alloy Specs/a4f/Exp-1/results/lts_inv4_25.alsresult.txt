The bug in this specification is in the predicate inv4. The correct code is: 

pred inv4 {
  let tr = { s1, e, s2 : State | s1->e->s2 in trans } | State in Init.^tr 
  all s : State | some i : Init | i -> s in tr
}

The corrected inv4 predicate ensures that all states can be reached from an initial state, by checking that for every state there exists a path from an initial state to that state.
