The bug in the specification is in the following line of code:

```
pred inv11 {
--  all c : Class | (some c.Groups) implies some Teacher & Teaches.c --correct
  all c : Class, s : Student, g : Group | c->s->g in Groups implies (some t : Teacher | t->c in Teaches) 
}
```

The commented out line is the correct statement, but it is not being executed because it is commented out. The line above it is incorrect.

The fixed code is:

```
pred inv11 {
  all c : Class | (some c.Groups) implies some Teacher & Teaches.c 
}
```
