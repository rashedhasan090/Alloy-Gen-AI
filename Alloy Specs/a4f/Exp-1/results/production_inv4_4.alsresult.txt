The bug in the specification is in the "inv4" predicate. The commented out line is incorrect and should be removed. 

Fixed code:

pred inv4 { // The parts required by a component cannot be assembled in a later position
    all c: Component | ((c.^parts) & Component).cposition not in (c.cposition).^next
}

All other parts of the specification are correct.
