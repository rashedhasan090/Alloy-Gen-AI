One possible fixed code:

-- A labeled transition system (LTS) is comprised by States, a sub-set
-- of which are Initial, connected by transitions, here represented by 
-- Events.
sig State {
        trans : Event -> State
}
sig Init in State {}
sig Event {}

-- The LTS does not contain deadlocks, ie, each state has at least a 
-- transition.
pred inv1 {
    all s: State | some s.trans
}

-- There is a single initial state.
pred inv2 {
    one Init
}

-- The LTS is deterministic, ie, each state has at most a transition for each event.
pred inv3 {
    all s : State, e : Event | lone e.(s.trans)
}

-- All states are reachable from an initial state.
pred inv4 {
    let tr = { s1, s2 : State | some e : Event | s1->e->s2 in trans } |
    State in Init.^tr
}

-- All states have the same events available.
pred inv5 {
    all e : Event |
        all x, y : State |
            (some x->e->y in trans) implies (some y->e->x in trans)
}

-- Each event is available in at least one state.
pred inv6 {
    all e : Event |
        some s1, s2 : State |
            s1->e->s2 in trans
}

-- The LTS is reversible, ie, from a reachable state it is always possible 
-- to return to an initial state.
pred inv7 {
    let tr = { s1, s2 : State | some e : Event | s1->e->s2 in trans } |
    all s : Init.^tr |
        some i : Init |
            i in s.^tr
}

-- Check that the repaired invariants hold.
pred repair_pred_1 {
    inv5[] iff inv5_OK[]
}
run repair_pred_1
assert repair_assert_1 {
    inv5[] iff inv5_OK[]
}
check repair_assert_1
