The bug in the specification is in the predicate stonglyConnected, where the first line should be commented out instead of the second line. The corrected predicate is as follows:

pred stonglyConnectedOK {
   all n:Node | Node in n.*adj
}
assert stonglyConnectedRepaired {
   stonglyConnected[]  iff stonglyConnectedOK[]
}
