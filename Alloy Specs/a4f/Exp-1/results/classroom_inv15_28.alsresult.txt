The bug in the specification is:

```
pred inv15 {
--  all s : Person | some Teacher & ^Tutors.s
    all p:Person | some t:Teacher | t in p.^~Teaches 
}
```

The intended line `all s : Person | some Teacher & ^Tutors.s` is commented out and instead a line that is unrelated to the intended constraint is used.

Repaired code:
```
pred inv15 {
    all s : Person | some Teacher & ^s.Tutors
}
```
