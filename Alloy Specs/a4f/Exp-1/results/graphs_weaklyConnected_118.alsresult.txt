The bug in this specification is in the "weaklyConnected" predicate. There is a commented out line that is meant to define the predicate correctly, but it is mistakenly commented out. 

Here is the fixed code:

pred weaklyConnected {
    all n:Node | Node in n.*(adj+~adj)
}

assert weaklyConnectedRepaired {
    weaklyConnected[] iff weaklyConnectedOK[]
}
