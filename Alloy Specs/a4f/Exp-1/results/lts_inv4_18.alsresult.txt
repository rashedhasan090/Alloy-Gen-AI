A solution to fix the bug is to add the following signature:

sig End in State{}

Then we update the inv4 predicate to include the End signature:

pred inv4 {
  all s : State | some s.(Init<:trans) 
  all s: End | some (s.trans).Init
}

This ensures that all states are reachable from the initial state and all states can reach the initial state as well. The complete fixed code is as follows:

/** A labeled transition system (LTS) is comprised by States, a sub-set
 *  of which are Initial, connected by transitions, here represented by 
 *  Events.
 */
sig State {
    trans : Event -> State
}
sig Init in State {}
sig End in State{}
sig Event {}

/** The LTS does not contain deadlocks, ie, each state has at least a 
 *  transition.
 */
pred inv1 {
    all s: State | some s.trans
}

/** There is a single initial state. */
pred inv2 {
    one Init
}

/** The LTS is deterministic, ie, each state has at most a transition for each event. */
pred inv3 {
    all s : State, e : Event | lone e.(s.trans)
}

/** All states are reachable from an initial state. */
pred inv4 {
    all s : State | some s.(Init<:trans) 
    all s: End | some (s.trans).Init
}

/** All the states have the same events available. */
pred inv5 {
    all s:State, s1:State | s.trans.State = s1.trans.State
}

/** Each event is available in at least a state. */
pred inv6 {
    all e:Event | some s1,s2:State | s1->e->s2 in trans
}

/** The LTS is reversible, ie, from a reachable state it is always possible 
 *  to return to an initial state.
 */
pred inv7 {
    let tr = { s1, s2 : State | some e : Event | s1->e->s2 in trans } |
    all s : Init.^tr | some i : Init | i in s.^tr
}

// Corrected Inv1
pred inv1_OK {
    all s: State | some s.trans
}
assert inv1_Repaired {
    inv1[] iff inv1_OK[]
}

// Corrected Inv2
pred inv2_OK {
    one Init
}
assert inv2_Repaired {
    inv2[] iff inv2_OK[]
}

// Corrected Inv3
pred inv3_OK {
    all s : State, e : Event | lone e.(s.trans)
}
assert inv3_Repaired {
    inv3[] iff inv3_OK[]
}

// Corrected Inv4

    all s : State | some s.(Init<:trans) 
    all s: End | some (s.trans).Init
}

}

// Corrected Inv5
pred inv5_OK {
    all s:State, s1:State | s.trans.State = s1.trans.State
}
assert inv5_Repaired {
    inv5[] iff inv5_OK[]
}

// Corrected Inv7
pred inv7_OK {
    let tr = { s1, s2 : State | some e : Event | s1->e->s2 in trans } |
    all s : Init.^tr | some i : Init | i in s.^tr
