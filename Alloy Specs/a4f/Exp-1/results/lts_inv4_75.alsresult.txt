The bug in the specification is in the predicate inv4. The let binding should include the Init subset, which represents the initial states. The fixed code is:

pred inv4_OK {
    let tr = { s1, s2 : State | some e : Event | s1->e->s2 in trans } |
    Init in Init.^tr --fixed
}
assert inv4_Repaired {
    inv4[] iff inv4_OK[]
}
