A possible fixed code is:

-- A labeled transition system (LTS) is comprised of States, a sub-set of which are Initial, connected by transitions, here represented by Events.
sig State {
    trans: Event -> State
}

sig Init in State {}

sig Event {}

-- The LTS does not contain deadlocks, i.e., each state has at least a transition.
pred inv1 {
    all s: State | some s.trans
}

-- There is a single initial state.
pred inv2 {
    one i: Init
}

-- The LTS is deterministic, i.e., each state has at most one transition for each event.
pred inv3 {
    all s: State, e: Event | lone s.trans[e]
}

-- All states are reachable from an initial state.
pred inv4 {
    let tr = {s1, s2: State | some e: Event | s1 -> e -> s2 in trans} |
    State in Init.^tr
}

-- All the states have the same events available.
pred inv5 {
    all s1, s2: State | s1.trans.Event = s2.trans.Event
}

-- Each event is available in at least one state.
pred inv6 {
    all e: Event | some s1, s2: State | s1 -> e -> s2 in trans
}

-- The LTS is reversible, i.e., from a reachable state it is always possible to return to an initial state.
pred inv7 {
    let tr = {s1, s2: State | some e: Event | s1 -> e -> s2 in trans} |
    all s: Init.^tr | some i: Init | i in s.^tr
}
