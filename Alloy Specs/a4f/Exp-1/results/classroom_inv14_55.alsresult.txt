The bug is in pred inv14, where the comment symbol "--" is missing. Here is the fixed code:

pred inv14 {
  -- all s : Person, c : Class, t : Person, g : Group | (c -> s -> g in Groups) and t -> c in Teaches implies t -> s in Tutors
  all s : Person, c : Class, t : Person, g : Group | (c -> s -> g in Groups) and t -> c in Teaches implies t -> s in Tutors
}
