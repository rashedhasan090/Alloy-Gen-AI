The bug in the specification is in the predicate inv14. The original predicate was: 

pred inv14 {
    --all s : Person, c : Class, t : Person, g : Group | (c -> s -> g in Groups) and t -> c in Teaches implies t -> s in Tutors
    all s : Person, c : Class, t : Teacher | (all g : Group | c->s->g in Groups) and t->c in Teaches implies t->s in Tutors 
}

The second clause of the implication, "t->c in Teaches implies t->s in Tutors", has t->c instead of c->s (which is what was likely intended). The corrected predicate is:

pred inv14_OK {
    all s : Person, c : Class, t : Teacher | (all g : Group | c->s->g in Groups) and t->c in Teaches implies t->s in Tutors 
}
