The original code is missing the definition for the Class signature, so I assumed it meant to include the definition of Class from the previous exercise.

Fixed code:

sig Person {
    Tutors : set Person,
    Teaches : set Class
}

sig Group {}

sig Class {
    Groups : Person -> Group
}

sig Teacher extends Person {}

sig Student extends Person {}

pred inv1 {
    Person in Student
}

pred inv2
