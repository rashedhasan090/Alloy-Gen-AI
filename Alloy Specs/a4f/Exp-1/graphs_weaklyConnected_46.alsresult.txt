The bug in the specification is in the pred weaklyConnected. The commented line of code "--all n:Node | Node in n.*(adj+~adj) --correct" is incorrect because it includes nodes that are not reachable from every other node. 

Fixed code for pred weaklyConnected:
```
pred weaklyConnected {
    all n1, n2: Node | n1 in n2.*(adj+~adj)
}
```
