The bug in the specification is in the predicate inv15, where the quantified variable s is incorrectly used as a predicate instead of a variable. 

Fixed code:

pred inv15_OK {
  all s : Person | some Teacher & ^Tutors.s --correct
}

assert inv15_Repaired {
  inv15[] iff inv15_OK[]
}

check inv15_Repaired
