The bug in this specification is in the "pred stonglyConnected" predicate where the word "stongly" is spelled incorrectly. It should be spelled "strongly". Here is the fixed code:

pred stonglyConnectedOK {
    all n:Node | Node in n.*adj
}

assert stonglyConnectedRepaired {
    stonglyConnected[]  iff stonglyConnectedOK[]
}
