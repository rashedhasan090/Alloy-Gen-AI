Explanation of Changes Made:

Bug in pred inv3 - no Student & Teacher has been updated to no Student and no Teacher.
Bug in pred inv6 - Teacher in Teaches.Class  has been updated to t in t.Teaches.Class
Bug in pred inv7 - Class in Teacher.Teaches has been updated to c in c.Groups.Person.Teacher.Teaches
Bug in pred inv9 - lone Teaches.c & Teacher has been updated to lone c.Groups.Person & Teacher
Bug in pred inv11 - some Teacher & Teaches.c has been updated to some g->c->Groups.Person.Teacher & Teacher.Teaches.c
Bug in pred inv14 - original predicate had two bugs which has been fixed: i) Teacher was not defined in the predicate, so we replace t not in Teaches.c with (all t:Teacher | t not in Teaches.c), ii) The implication in the original predicate was wrong, so we changed it to an equivalent implication where if t->c is not in Tutors, then t->s is not in Tutors.
