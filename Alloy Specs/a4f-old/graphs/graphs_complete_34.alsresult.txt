The bug in this specification is in the "complete" predicate. The correct code is:

pred complete {
   all n:Node | n.adj = Node   --fixed
}

The updated code sets the outgoing edges of every node to be the set of all nodes in the system. This ensures that every node has a direct edge to every other node and makes the graph complete.
