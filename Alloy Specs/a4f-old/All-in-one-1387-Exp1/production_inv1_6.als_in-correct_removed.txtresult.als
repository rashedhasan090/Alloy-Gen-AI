The bug in the specification is that the inv3 predicate does not take into account the possibility that there may be positions with no robots. This can cause the assertion inv3_Repaired to fail. 

The fix is to use the lone operator instead of one for the rposition field in the Robot signature, so that each position must have exactly one robot assigned to it. Then, in the inv3 predicate, use the join operator instead of the subset operator to find all positions that have robots, and require that the component's cposition is in that set. 

Here is the fixed code:

open util/ordering[Position]

// Consider the following model of an automated production line
// The production line consists of several positions in sequence
sig Position {}

// Products are either components assembled in the production line or 
// other resources (e.g. pre-assembled products or base materials)
sig Product {}

// Components are assembled in a given position from other parts
sig Component extends Product {
    parts : set Product,
    cposition : one Position
}

sig Resource extends Product {}

// Robots work somewhere in the production line
sig Robot {
    rposition : lone Position
}

// Specify the following invariants!
// You can check their correctness with the different commands and
// specifying a given invariant you can assume the others to be true.
pred inv1 { // A component requires at least one part
    all c:Component | some c.parts
}

pred inv2 { // A component cannot be a part of itself
    all c:Component | c not in c.^parts
}

pred inv3 { // The position where a component is assembled must have at least one robot
    all c:Component | c.cposition in (Robot.rposition).^rposition
}

pred inv4 { // The parts required by a component cannot be assembled in a later position
    all c:Component | c.parts.cposition in c.cposition.*prev 
}

/*======== IFF PERFECT ORACLE ===============*/

    all c:Component | some c.parts --correct

    inv1[] iff inv1_OK[]
