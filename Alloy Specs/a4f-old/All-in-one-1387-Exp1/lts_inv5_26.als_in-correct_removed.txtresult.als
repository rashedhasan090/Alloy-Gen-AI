There is a comment in the code that indicates where the error is but there is no indication of how to fix it. Therefore, based on the comment, the error appears to be in invariant 5, which has a commented out line of code that should be uncommented. The line should read:

```
all s:State, e:Event | e in s.trans.Event --fixed
```
