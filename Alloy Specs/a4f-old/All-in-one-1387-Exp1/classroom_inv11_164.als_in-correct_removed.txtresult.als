The bug in the specification is in predicate inv11. The commented out line should be removed, and a new line should be added with the corrected condition.

Fixed code:

/* A class only has groups if it has a teacher assigned. */
pred inv11 {
    all c : Class | (some c.Groups) implies some t : Teacher | t in c.Teaches
}
