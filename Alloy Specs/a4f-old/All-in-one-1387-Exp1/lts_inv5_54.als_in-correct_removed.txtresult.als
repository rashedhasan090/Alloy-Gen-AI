The bug in this specification is in the comment of the predicate inv5. The comment suggests that the predicate should check if all states have the same events available, but the actual predicate implementation is for something else. The predicate checks if for all states and all other states, if they have the same transition function, then they have the same events available. 

The fixed code for predicate inv5 is:

/* All the states have the same events available. */
pred inv5 {
    all s1, s2 : State | s1.trans = s2.trans implies s1.trans.Event = s2.trans.Event
}
