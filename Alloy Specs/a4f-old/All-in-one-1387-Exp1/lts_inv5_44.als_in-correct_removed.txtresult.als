There is a commented out line in `inv5` predicate. The line should be uncommented and `State` should be replaced with `Event` for correct comparison. 

The fixed code is as follows:

```
/*\n 
All the states have the same events available.
*/
pred inv5 {
    all s, s1: State |
        s.trans.Event = s1.trans.Event --Fixed
}

```

Note: The bug was in predicate `inv5`, where both the commented out line and the subsequent `all` statement were attempting to compare the states' transitions instead of the events' transitions.
