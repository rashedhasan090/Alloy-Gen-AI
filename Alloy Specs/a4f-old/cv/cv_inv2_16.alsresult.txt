The bug in the specification is in the inv2_OK predicate, where the variable "w" is not properly quantified. The fixed code is as follows:

pred inv2_OK {
    all u:User, w:Work | w in u.profile implies (
        u in w.source or some i:Institution | i in w.source
    )
}

All the check and run commands will remain unchanged.
