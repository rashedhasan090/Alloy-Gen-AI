The bug in the 'Sorted' predicate is that it is comparing the element of a node with the element of its link, but it is not checking whether the link actually exists. This can lead to a comparison between an element and no element (if the node has no link), which violates the predicate. To fix this, we need to add a condition that checks whether the link exists before comparing the elements.

Here is the corrected 'Sorted' predicate:

pred Sorted ( This : List ) {
    all n: This.header.*link | no n.link or n.elem <= n.link.elem
}

The added condition 'no n.link or' checks whether the link exists before comparing the elements.

With this correction, the assertions pass successfully.
