The bug in the 'Sorted' predicate is that it doesn't specify the order in which the elements of the list should be sorted. Here is a fixed version of the 'Sorted' predicate that sorts the elements of the list in ascending order:

// Fixed
pred Sorted(This: List) {
    all n1,n2: Node | n1 in This.header.*link && n2 in This.header.*link && n1 != n2 =>
        n1.elem < n2.elem implies n1.link = n2
} 

This predicate says that for any two distinct nodes 'n1' and 'n2' in the list, if 'n1' elem is less than 'n2' elem, then 'n1' should be linked to 'n2'. This specifies that the elements of the list should be sorted in ascending order of their values.
