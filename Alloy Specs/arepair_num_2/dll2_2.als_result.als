The bug is in the Sorted predicate. The current predicate checks that for all nodes n, the element of n is less than the element of n's next node. However, this only checks if the list is sorted in ascending order if every element is unique, which is not necessarily true. To fix the bug, the predicate should check that for all pairs of adjacent nodes n1 and n2, the element of n1 is less than or equal to the element of n2. This can be done with the following predicate:

// Part (c)
pred Sorted() {
  // The list is sorted in ascending order (<=) along nxt.
  all n1, n2: Node | n1.nxt = n2 => n1.elem <= n2.elem
}
