The bug is in the predicate ConsistentPreAndNxt(). It is currently empty and does not specify any constraints. To fix the bug, we need to add the following constraint to ensure that the prev and link pointers of nodes are consistent:

pred ConsistentPreAndNxt() {
  all n1, n2: Node | n1.nxt = n2 <=> n2.pre = n1
}

This predicate states that for any two adjacent nodes n1 and n2, if n1 is followed by n2, then n2 is preceded by n1. This ensures that the prev and link pointers of nodes are consistent.

With this fix, the RepOk() predicate and the assertions should now pass.
