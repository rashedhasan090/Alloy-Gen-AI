The bug in the specification is in the predicate "Sorted". The "all n2:n.^left | n2.elem < n.elem" should be changed to "all n2:n.^left | n2.elem <= n.elem". Similarly, the "all n2:n.^right | n2.elem > n.elem" should be changed to "all n2:n.^right | n2.elem >= n.elem". This is because a binary tree can have nodes with equal values in both the left and right subtrees.

The corrected "Sorted" predicate is as follows:
```
pred Sorted() {
  all n:Node {
    // All elements in the n's left subtree are smaller than or equal to the n's elem.
    all n2:n.^left | n2.elem <= n.elem
    // All elements in the n's right subtree are bigger than or equal to the n's elem.
    all n2:n.^right | n2.elem >= n.elem
  }
}
```

With this corrected specification, the "repair_assert_1" assertion and "repair_pred_1" predicate should hold.
