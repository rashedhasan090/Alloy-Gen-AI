The bug in the 'Sorted' predicate is that it assumes that all nodes in the list have a 'link' relationship to another node, which is not necessarily true for the last node in the list. To fix the bug, the predicate should consider cases where a node does not have a 'link' relationship and simply skip over those nodes. The corrected 'Sorted' predicate is:

// Corrected
pred Sorted(This: List) {
  all n:(This.header.*link) |
    (n.link in Node => n.elem <= n.link.elem)
} 

With this correction, the 'repair_assert_1' assertion and 'repair_pred_1' predicate should now pass.
