The bug in the Sorted predicate is that it compares the element of a node with the element of its next node by using "nxt.elem", which is incorrect. We need to compare the element of a node with the element of its next node by using "nxt.elem" only if the next node exists; otherwise, the comparison should be true. The correct Sorted predicate is:

pred Sorted() {
  // The list is sorted in ascending order (<=) along nxt.
  all n: Node | n.nxt.elem = no elem or n.elem <= n.nxt.elem
}

With this fix, the assertions will be satisfied.
