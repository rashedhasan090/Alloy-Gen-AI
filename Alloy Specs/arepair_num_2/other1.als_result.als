The bug is that the fact statement allows both alas and peds to be located in seclab, but they should be mutually exclusive. To fix the bug, we can add a disjointness constraint between alas and peds using the "disj" keyword.

The corrected Alloy specification is:

//people
sig Person {
   member_of : some Group
}

pred CanEnter(p: Person, r:Room) {
    p.member_of in r.located_in
}

// groups
sig Group {}
one sig alas extends Group {}
one sig peds extends Group {}

//rooms
sig Room {
  located_in: set Group
}
one sig seclab extends Room {}

fact {
  // Fix: alas and peds should be disjoint
  disj[alas, peds]
  alas in seclab.located_in or peds in seclab.located_in
}

// assertion
assert repair_assert_1 {
   all p : Person | CanEnter[p, seclab] implies alas in p.member_of or peds in p.member_of
}
check repair_assert_1

pred repair_pred_1{
   all p : Person | CanEnter[p, seclab] implies alas in p.member_of or peds in p.member_of
}
run repair_pred_1
