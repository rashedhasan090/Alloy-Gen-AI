The bug in this specification is that the BinaryTree signature does not specify a parent-child relationship between nodes, which leads to the repetition of nodes in the Reachable fact. To fix this, we need to add a parent reference to the Node signature and use it to define the parent-child relationship in the BinaryTree signature.

The corrected Alloy specification is as follows:

```alloy
sig BinaryTree {
  root: lone Node
}

sig Node {
  left, right: lone Node,
  elem: Int,
  parent: lone Node
}

// All nodes are in the tree.
fact Reachable {
  Node = BinaryTree.root.*(left + right) + BinaryTree.root
  all n: Node | n in n.*(left + right) and n.parent in n.*parent
}

fact Acyclic {
  all n:Node {
    // There are no directed cycles, i.e., a node is not reachable
    // from itself along one or more traversals of left or right.
    n not in n.^parent

    // A node cannot have more than one parent
    lone n.parent

    // A node cannot have another node as both its left child
    // and right child.
    no n.left & n.right
  }
}

pred Sorted() {
  all n:Node {
    // All elements in the n's left subtree are smaller than the n's elem.
    all n2:n.^left | n2.elem < n.elem
    // All elements in the n's right subtree are bigger than the n's elem.
    all n2:n.^right | n2.elem > n.elem
  }
}

pred HasAtMostOneChild(n:Node) {
  // Node n has at most one child
  #n.(left+right) <= 1
}

fun Depth(n: Node): one Int {
  // The number of nodes from the tree's root to n.
  #n.*parent
}

pred Balanced() {
  // If n1 has at most one child and n2 has at most one child, then the
  // depths of n1 and n2 differ by at most 1.
  // Multiplying depth differences by the signum to get rid of negatives.
  // Is there an absolute value in alloy?
  all n1, n2: Node {
    (HasAtMostOneChild[n1] && HasAtMostOneChild[n2]) <=> (mul[signum[minus[Depth[n1], Depth[n2]]], minus[Depth[n1], Depth[n2]]] <= 1)
  }
}

pred RepOk() {
  Sorted
  Balanced
}

run RepOk for 5

assert repair_assert_2{
  Balanced <=>
  all n1, n2: Node {
    (HasAtMostOneChild[n1] && HasAtMostOneChild[n2]) => (mul[signum[minus[Depth[n1], Depth[n2]]], minus[Depth[n1], Depth[n2]]] <= 1)
