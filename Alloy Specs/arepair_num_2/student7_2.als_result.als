The bug in the 'Loop' predicate is that the condition should be applied to 'This.header' instead of just 'header'. The correct predicate is:

pred Loop(This: List) {
    all n: Node | n in This.header.link.^(link)
    no This.header
}

The first line ensures that there are no loops in the list by checking that each node is not reachable from itself via the 'link' relation. The second line ensures that there is at most one header in the list by checking that the set of headers is empty. 

With this fix, the 'repair_assert_2' assertion should pass.
