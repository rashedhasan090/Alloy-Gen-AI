The bug in the specification is in the complete predicate. The correct version of the predicate is:

pred complete {
  all n:Node | n.adj = Node - n --fixed
}
The complete predicate checks whether every node in the graph is connected to every other node. The previous version of the predicate was incorrect because it checked whether Node (the set of all nodes) was in the adjacency set of every node, which can never be true.
