The fixed predicate inv15 is provided below:

/* The tutoring chain of every person eventually reaches a Teacher. */
pred inv15_OK {
  all s : Person | some Teacher & ^Tutors.s 
}

The bug was in the original predicate inv15. It checked for a chain of three persons (p, q, and r) where any two of them are connected by a tutoring relationship. However, it did not ensure that all three persons were connected, which led to false counterexamples. The repaired predicate ensures that every person in the system is eventually tutored by a teacher.
