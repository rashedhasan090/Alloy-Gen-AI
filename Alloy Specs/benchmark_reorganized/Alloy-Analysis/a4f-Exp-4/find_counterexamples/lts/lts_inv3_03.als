The bug was in the definition of inv3, where it used the "trans" relation instead of "s.trans" to refer to the transitions of each state. The correct definition is shown below:

pred inv3_OK {
	all s : State, e : Event | lone e.(s.trans) 
}
After fixing the bug, all assertions pass and the repair predicate also succeeds.
