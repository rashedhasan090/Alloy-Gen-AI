pred inv7 {
	all x : State, y : Init | some z : Event | y -> z -> x in trans
	all x : State | some y : Init | some z : Event | y -> z -> x in trans
}

This fixes the issue where there is no guarantee that an initial state has a transition for every event, and the repair checks for inv7 should pass now.
