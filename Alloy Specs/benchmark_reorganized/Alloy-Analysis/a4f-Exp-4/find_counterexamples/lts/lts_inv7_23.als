The repaired predicate inv7_OK is provided below:

pred inv7_OK {
    let tr = { s1, s2 : State | some e : Event | s1->e->s2 in trans } |
    all s : Init.^tr | some i : Init | i in s.^tr 
} 

Note that the "one -> one" in the original predicate has been replaced with "^" (transitive closure) to ensure that the predicate is checking for a path of transitions, not just a single transition.
