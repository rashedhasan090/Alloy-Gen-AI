The bug in the specification is in inv1, the predicate that checks that all states have at least one transition. The correct predicate is inv1_OK, which checks that all states have at least one outgoing transition. 

Here is the fixed code:

/*
A labeled transition system (LTS) is comprised by States, a sub-set
of which are Initial, connected by transitions, here represented by 
Events.
*/
sig State {
        trans : Event -> State
}
sig Init in State {}
sig Event {}
/*
The LTS does not contain deadlocks, ie, each state has at least a 
transition.
*/
pred inv1_OK {
	all s: State | some s.trans 
}
/*
There is a single initial state.
*/
pred inv2_OK {
	one Init 
}
/*
The LTS is deterministic, ie, each state has at most a transition for each event.
*/
pred inv3_OK {
	all s : State, e : Event | lone e.(s.trans)  
}
/*
All states are reachable from an initial state.
*/
pred inv4_OK {
    let tr = { s1, s2 : State | some e : Event | s1->e->s2 in trans } |
  State in Init.^tr 
}
/*
All the states have the same events available.
*/
pred inv5_OK {
	all s:State, s1:State | s.trans.State = s1.trans.State 
}
/*
Each event is available in at least a state.
*/
pred inv6_OK {
	all e:Event | some s1,s2:State | s1->e->s2 in trans 
}
/*
The LTS is reversible, ie, from a reacheable state it is always possible 
to return to an initial state.
*/
pred inv7_OK {
  let tr = { s1, s2 : State | some e : Event | s1->e->s2 in trans } |
	all s : Init.^tr | some i : Init | i in s.^tr 
}
