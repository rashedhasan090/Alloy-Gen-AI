The bug in the specification is in the predicate `inv7`. The correct predicate should be:

/*
The LTS is reversible, ie, from a reachable state it is always possible 
to return to an initial state.
*/
pred inv7 {
    all s1,s2:State, e1,e2:Event |
    s1->e1->s2 in trans implies some s3:Init | s2->e2->s3 in trans 
}

Note that we added the "some s3:Init" condition, to ensure that the state we are returning to is an initial state.
