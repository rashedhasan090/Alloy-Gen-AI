The bug in the specification is in the inv5 predicate. The correct predicate should be:

pred inv5 {
    all s: State, s1: State |
        all e: Event |
            (s.trans).(e) = s1 -> some e': Event |
                (s1.trans).(e') = s
}

This ensures that for any two states, if a transition is possible from the first state to the second state via an event, then there must be a corresponding transition from the second state to the first state via another event.
