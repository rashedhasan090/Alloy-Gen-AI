The bug is in the inv2 predicate. The correct predicate is provided below:

pred inv2 { // A user profile can only have works added by himself or some external institution
	all u:User, w:Work | w in u.profile implies (u in w.source or some i:Institution | i in i.source & w.source)
} 

The other parts of the code are correct.
