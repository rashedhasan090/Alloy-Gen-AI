The bug is in the `inv2` predicate. The quantification should be separated between the user and the work, instead of being combined in one statement. Additionally, the set of works in a user's profile should only include works with matching sources. The fixed code is:

```
pred inv2 {
    all u: User, w: Work |
        w in u.profile implies (u in w.source or some i: Institution | i in w.source)
        and w.source in u.source
}
```
