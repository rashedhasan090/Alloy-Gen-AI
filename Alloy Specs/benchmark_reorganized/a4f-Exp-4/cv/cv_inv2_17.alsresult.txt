The bug in the specification is in the predicate inv2, which has a commented out part that is incorrect. The correct predicate is:

pred inv2 { 
	all u : User | (u.profile <: Work[source = u]) + (u.profile <: Work[source = Institution]) = u.profile
}

The corrected predicate checks that the works in a user's profile are either added by the user or by an external institution.

With this fix, the Alloy model should pass all the provided checks without any errors or warnings.
