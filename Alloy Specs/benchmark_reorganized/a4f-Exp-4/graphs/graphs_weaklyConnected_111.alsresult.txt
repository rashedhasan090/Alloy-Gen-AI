The bug in the specification is in the `weaklyConnected` predicate where the operator `+` should be used instead of `.`. The fixed code is:

/*
The graph is weakly connected, ie, it is possible to reach every node from every node ignoring edge direction.

*/
pred weaklyConnected {
 all x : Node | Node in x.adj + (~adj).x + x 
}

Other than this, the code seems correct.
