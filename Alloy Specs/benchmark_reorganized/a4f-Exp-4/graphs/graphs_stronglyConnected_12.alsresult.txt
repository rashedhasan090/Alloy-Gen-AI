The bug in this specification is in the "stonglyConnectedOK" predicate, where instead of using the transitive closure of the reverse adjacency relation to check for strong connectivity, it only uses the closure of the forward adjacency relation. 

The fixed code for "stonglyConnectedOK" predicate is as follows:

pred stonglyConnectedOK {
	all n:Node | Node in n.*(adj+~adj) // use closure of forwards and backwards adjacency relations
}

With this change, the Alloy specification should now be correct.
