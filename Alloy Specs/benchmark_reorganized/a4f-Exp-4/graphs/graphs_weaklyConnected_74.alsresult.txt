The bug in the specification is in the "weaklyConnectedOK" predicate where '+' operator is used instead of '|' in the formula. The fixed code is as follows:

pred weaklyConnectedOK {
    all n:Node | Node in n.^adj + n.^~adj + n
}
assert weaklyConnectedRepaired {
    weaklyConnected[]  iff weaklyConnectedOK[]
}
