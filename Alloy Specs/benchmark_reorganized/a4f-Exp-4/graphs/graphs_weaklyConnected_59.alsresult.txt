The bug is in the "weaklyConnectedOK" predicate, where the union operator should be used instead of the intersection operator in the expression "n.*(adj+~adj)" to compute the transitive closure of the graph. The fixed predicate is:

pred weaklyConnectedOK {
    all n:Node | Node in n.*(adj+~adj)
}

The rest of the specification is correct.
