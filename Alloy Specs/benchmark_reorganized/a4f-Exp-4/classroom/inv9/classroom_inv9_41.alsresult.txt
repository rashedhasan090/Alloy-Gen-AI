The bug in this specification is in predicate inv9. The predicate checks that no class has more than one teacher assigned to it, but it mistakenly includes the condition (no Student & Teacher), which means that no one can be both a student and a teacher. This is incorrect, as the specification allows for some persons to be both teachers and students.

The fixed code for inv9 is:

/* No class has more than one teacher assigned.*/
pred inv9 {
	all c:Class | lone t:Teacher | t.Teaches = c and t not in Student
}

Note: This predicate checks that each class has at most one teacher assigned to it, and that the assigned teacher is not a student.
