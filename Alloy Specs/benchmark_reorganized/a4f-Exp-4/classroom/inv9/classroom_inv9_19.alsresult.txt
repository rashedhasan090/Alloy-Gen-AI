The bug is in the predicate inv9, where the expression "lone Teacher.Teaches" should be replaced with "lone c.Teacher.Teaches". The fixed code is:

/* No class has more than a teacher assigned. */
pred inv9 {
    all c:Class | lone c.Teacher.Teaches:>c 
} 

And the repaired assertion is:

assert inv9_Repaired {
    inv9[] iff inv9_OK[]
}
