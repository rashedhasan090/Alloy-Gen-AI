The bug in the specification is in the predicate inv14. The implication t -> c in Teaches implies t -> s in Tutors should be reversed to s -> t in Tutors implies t -> c in Teaches. The fixed predicate inv14 is:

pred inv14_OK {
    all s : Person, c : Class, t : Person, g : Group | (c -> s -> g in Groups) and s -> t in Tutors implies t -> c in Teaches
}
