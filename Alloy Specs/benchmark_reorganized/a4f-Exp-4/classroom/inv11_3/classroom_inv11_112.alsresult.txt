The bug is in the predicate inv11. Its current statement says that "A class only has groups if it has a teacher assigned", but the correct statement should be "A class has groups only if it has a teacher assigned". To fix it, we need to switch the order of the implications in the predicate.

Fixed code:

/* A class has groups only if it has a teacher assigned. */
pred inv11 {
    all c : Class | some Groups.c implies some Teaches.c 
}
