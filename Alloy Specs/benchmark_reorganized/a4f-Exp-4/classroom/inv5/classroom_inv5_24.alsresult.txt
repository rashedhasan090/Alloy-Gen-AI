There is a bug in the inv5 predicate. It states that "there are some classes assigned to teachers," but it should say "there are some teachers assigned to classes." The corrected predicate is:

/* Some teachers are assigned to classes. */
pred inv5 {
 some t : Teacher | some c : Class | c in t.Teaches 
}
