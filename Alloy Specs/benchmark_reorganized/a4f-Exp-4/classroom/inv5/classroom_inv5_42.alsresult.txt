The bug is in the specification of `inv5`. It is an empty predicate and therefore does not capture any constraints. To fix it, we need to specify a constraint that ensures that there are some classes assigned to teachers. The fixed `inv5` predicate is:

```
/* Some classes are assigned to teachers. */
pred inv5 {
  some Teacher.Teaches 
}
```
