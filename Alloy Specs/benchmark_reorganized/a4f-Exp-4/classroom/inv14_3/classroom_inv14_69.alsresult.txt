The bug is in inv14, where the variable g is not constrained to be in the Groups of the given class c. To fix it, we need to add the constraint c->g in Groups in the quantifier for g.

The fixed code for inv14 is:

pred inv14_OK {
  all s : Person, c : Class, t : Person, g : Group | (c -> s -> g in Groups) and (c->g in Groups) and t -> c in Teaches implies t -> s in Tutors 
}
