The bug in the specification is in inv13. The predicate is checking for a relation that is not defined in the signatures, and the correct condition for tutoring is not properly established. The fixed code for inv13 is:

/* Only teachers tutor, and only students are tutored. */
pred inv13 {
	all t:Teacher | t.Teaches.Tutors in Teacher and t.Tutors in Student
}
