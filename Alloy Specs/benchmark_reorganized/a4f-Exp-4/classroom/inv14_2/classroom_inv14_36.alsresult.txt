The bug is in the inv14 predicate. The correct version of the predicate is:

/* Every student in a class is at least tutored by all the teachers
 * assigned to that class. */
pred inv14 {
  all c:Class, s:Student | some g:Group | (c->s->g) in Groups implies all t:Teacher | t->c in Teaches implies t in s.^Tutors[g]
} 

The repaired version of inv14 has been provided in the fixed code.
