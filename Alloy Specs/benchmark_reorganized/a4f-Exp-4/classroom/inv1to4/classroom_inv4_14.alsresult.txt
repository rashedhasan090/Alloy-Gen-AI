The bug in this specification is in the `inv4` predicate. The correct predicate should state that every person is either a student or a teacher, but not both. The repaired predicate and its corresponding assert statement are as follows:

```
pred inv4_OK {
  all p:Person | (p in Student) xor (p in Teacher)
}
assert inv4_Repaired {
  inv4[] iff inv4_OK[]
}
```
