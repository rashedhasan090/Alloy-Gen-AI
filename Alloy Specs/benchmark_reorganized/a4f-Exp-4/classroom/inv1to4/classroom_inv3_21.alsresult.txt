The bug is in inv3 predicate which needs to be repaired. The repaired predicate and its associated assertion are as follows:

/* No person is both a student and a teacher. */
pred inv3 {
	no Student & Teacher 
}
pred inv3_OK {
  no Student & Teacher 
}
assert inv3_Repaired {
    inv3[] iff inv3_OK[]
}
