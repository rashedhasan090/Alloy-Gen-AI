The bug in this specification is in the predicate inv14. The implication should be from "all students in a class are tutored by all the teachers assigned to that class" to "every student in a class is at least tutored by all the teachers assigned to that class." The repaired code for this predicate, along with its corresponding assert and check commands, is:

/* Every student in a class is at least tutored by all the teachers
 * assigned to that class. */
pred inv14_OK {
  all s : Person, c : Class, t : Teacher, g : Group | (c -> s -> g in Groups) and t -> c in Teaches implies s -> t in Tutors
}
assert inv14_Repaired {
  inv14[] iff inv14_OK[]
}
check inv14_Repaired expect 0
