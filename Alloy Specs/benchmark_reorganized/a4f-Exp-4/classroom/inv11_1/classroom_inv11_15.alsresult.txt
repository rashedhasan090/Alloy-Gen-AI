The bug is in "pred inv11". The predicate should state that if a class has groups assigned to it, then it must have a teacher assigned to it. The repaired code for this predicate is:

/* A class only has groups if it has a teacher assigned. */
pred inv11_OK {
  all c : Class | (some c.Groups) implies some Teacher & Teaches.c 
}
assert inv11_Repaired {
    inv11[] iff inv11_OK[]
}
