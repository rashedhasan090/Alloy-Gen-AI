The bug is in the inv11 predicate. The last implication (implies) is reversed. It should be "if c has groups assigned, then there exists a teacher who teaches c". The fixed predicate is:

/* A class only has groups if it has a teacher assigned. */
pred inv11 {
    all c : Class | some s : Student | some g : Group | c->s->g in Groups implies (some t : Teacher | t->c in Teaches) 
}
