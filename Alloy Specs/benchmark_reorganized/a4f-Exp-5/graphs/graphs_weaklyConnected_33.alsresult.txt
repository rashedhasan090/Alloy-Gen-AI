The bug in the weaklyConnected predicate is that it uses the wrong relation to compute the possible paths between nodes. The correct relation to use is the reflexive-transitive closure of the union between the adjacency relation and its symmetric closure. 

Fixed weaklyConnected predicate:

pred weaklyConnected {
  all n, x :Node | some n2:Node | n in (n2.^(adj + ~adj)) + ~(~adj).x 
}
