The bug in the specification is that the ConsistentPreAndNxt predicate does not correctly ensure that a node's pre and nxt pointers are consistent. The commented out code suggests that the intention was to ensure that if n1 is the predecessor of n2, then n2 is the successor of n1, and vice versa. To fix this, the following code can replace the existing ConsistentPreAndNxt predicate:

pred ConsistentPreAndNxt() {
  all n1, n2: Node {
    n1.nxt = n2 implies n2.pre = n1
    n2.pre = n1 implies n1.nxt = n2
  }
}

This modified predicate explicitly states that if n1's nxt is n2, then n2's pre must be n1, and if n2's pre is n1, then n1's nxt must be n2. This ensures that the pre and nxt pointers are consistent both ways. With this modification, the repair_assert_3 and repair_pred_3 assertions should both pass.
