The bug in the specification is in the Loop predicate. The condition "n.link in n" should be changed to "This in n.link". This predicate checks whether the list contains a loop, but the original condition was checking whether a node links to itself, which is not what we want. Here is the corrected predicate:

// Corrected
pred Loop (This : List){
    no This.header || one n:This.header.*link | This in n.link
}

With this correction, all assertions should pass.
