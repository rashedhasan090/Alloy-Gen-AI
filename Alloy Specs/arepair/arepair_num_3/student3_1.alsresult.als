The bug in this specification is in the 'Sorted' predicate. The predicate should compare the element of a node with the element of its linked node only if there is a link between them. The corrected 'Sorted' predicate is:

pred Sorted(This: List) {
    all n: Node | no n.link => True else n.elem < n.link.elem
}

With this correction, the 'repair_assert_1' assertion and 'repair_pred_1' predicate will pass, meaning the specification now satisfies the desired properties.
