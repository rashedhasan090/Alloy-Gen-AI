The bug is in the `AllExtObject` predicate. Specifically, the formula `c in c.*ext` should be replaced with `c.*ext in Object`. This is because we want to ensure that every subclass of `Object` is in `c.*ext`. The corrected `AllExtObject` predicate is shown below:

```
pred AllExtObject() {
  // Each class other than Object is a sub-class of Object.
  all c: Class - Object | c.*ext in Object
}
```

With this correction, all assertions pass successfully.
