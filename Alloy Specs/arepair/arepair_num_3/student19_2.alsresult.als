The overconstraint in the Sorted predicate is causing it to fail. It should allow nodes with no link, so the predicate should be updated to include this case:

```
pred Sorted(This: List) {
    all n: This.header.*link | lone n.link implies n.elem <= n.link.elem
}
```

With this change, the assertions pass and the repair_pred_2 predicate produces the expected results.
