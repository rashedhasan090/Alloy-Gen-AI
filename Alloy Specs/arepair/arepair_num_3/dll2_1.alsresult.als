The bug in the specification is in the Sorted predicate. The current predicate only checks if an element is less than its immediate neighbor, but it does not ensure that all elements in the list are sorted in ascending order. To fix the bug, we can use transitive closure to check if all elements are sorted in ascending order.

The correct Sorted predicate is:

```
pred Sorted() {
  // The list is sorted in ascending order (<=) along nxt.
  all n1, n2: Node | n1 in DLL.header.*nxt and n2 in n1.*nxt |
    n1.elem <= n2.elem
}
```

This predicate checks that for every pair of nodes `n1` and `n2`, where `n1` is reachable from the header and `n2` is reachable from `n1`, `n1.elem` is less than or equal to `n2.elem`. This ensures that all elements in the list are sorted in ascending order.

With this fixed predicate, the assertions should all be satisfied.
