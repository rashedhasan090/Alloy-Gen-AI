The bug is in the predicate `InBound`. The two quantifiers are not working together as expected. They are functioning as separate quantifiers instead of combined quantifiers. The correct definition is as follows:

```
pred InBound {
  // All indexes should be greater than or equal to 0
  // and less than the array length
  all i: Int | i >= 0 and i < Array.length implies i in Array.i2e

  // Array length should be greater than equal to 0,
  // but also since there is a one-to-one mapping from
  // index to element, we restrict the array length to the
  // number of elements.
  Array.length = #Element
}
```

The repaired `assert` and `pred` are:

```
assert repair_assert_1{
  InBound <=> {
    all i: Int | i >= 0 and i < Array.length implies i in Array.i2e
    Array.length >= 0
  }
}
check repair_assert_1

pred repair_pred_1{
  InBound and {
    all i: Int | i >= 0 and i < Array.length implies i in Array.i2e
    Array.length >= 0
  }
}
run repair_pred_1
```
