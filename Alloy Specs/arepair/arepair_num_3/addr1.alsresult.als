The bug in this specification is that the assertion 'repair_assert_1' is not satisfied. It asserts that there exists at least one book and at least one entry in that book that is an Address, but the current specification does not ensure this. 

To fix this, we need to add a constraint that ensures at least one entry in each Book is an Address. We can do this by adding the following constraint:

    fact { all b:Book | some n : b.entry | lookup[b,n] & Address != {} }

This ensures that for every Book, there exists at least one entry that is an Address. With this constraint, the 'repair_assert_1' assertion should be satisfied.

The updated Alloy specification looks like:

/* Specification */
abstract sig Listing { }
sig Address extends Listing { }
sig Name extends Listing { }
sig Book {
    entry: set Name, // T1
    listed: entry ->set Listing // T2
}
fun lookup [b: Book, n: Name] : set Listing {n.^(b.listed)}

// constraints
// T. holeType constraints (multiplicity & range restriction)
// T1
// set
// T2
// A name entry maps to at most one name or address.
fact {all b:Book | all n:b.entry | lone b.listed[n] }
// At least one entry in each book must be an address
fact { all b:Book | some n : b.entry | lookup[b,n] & Address != {} }
// F. fact constraints
// F1 All names reachable from any name entry in the book are themselves entries.
fact { all b:Book | all n,l:Name | l in lookup[b,n] implies l in b.entry }
// F2 Acyclic
fact { all b:Book | all n:b.entry | not n in lookup[b,n] }


/* Refinement Task */ 
// A. assertion (universal statement over constraints; in this case, C1)
assert repair_assert_1 {
    all b:Book | all n:b.entry | some (lookup[b,n]&Address)
}
check repair_assert_1 for exactly 1 Address, exactly 2 Name, exactly 1 Book

// P. problem (subset of the universal statement over constraints)
// some b:Book | some n:b.entry_in | no (lookup[b,n]&Addr)
//fact {all b:Book | all n:b.entry_in | some b.target_of[n]}

pred repair_pred_1 {
    all b:Book | all n:b.entry | some (lookup[b,n]&Address)
}
run repair_pred_1 for exactly 1 Address, exactly 2 Name, exactly 1 Book
