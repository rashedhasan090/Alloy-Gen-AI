The bug is in the Sorted predicate. As it is currently written, it assumes that all nodes in the List have a link, which is not necessarily true. Therefore, we need to add a constraint that ensures that nodes without a link are considered sorted.

The fixed Sorted predicate is as follows:

pred Sorted(This: List) {
    all n: Node | n.link.elem = {} or n.elem <= n.link.elem
}

The constraint "n.link.elem = {}" ensures that nodes without a link are considered sorted, because an empty set is always a subset of any other set. 

With this fix, all assertions pass.
