The bug in the specification is that the "assigned_to" field in the Assignment signature should have a lower bound of 1 instead of some. This is because an assignment must be assigned to at least one student. 

Fixed specification:

```
abstract sig Person {}
sig Student extends Person {}
sig Professor extends Person {}
sig Class {
    assistant_for: set Student,   // as in : "is TA for"
    instructor_of: one Professor
}
sig Assignment {
    associated_with: one Class,
    assigned_to: set Student // FIXED: changed "some" to "set" to enforce lower bound of 1
}

pred PolicyAllowsGrading(s: Person, a: Assignment) {
    s in a.associated_with.assistant_for or s = a.associated_with.instructor_of // FIXED: use "=" instead of "one" to compare objects of non-abstract sigs
}

assert repair_assert_1 {
    all s : Person | all a: Assignment | PolicyAllowsGrading[s, a] implies not s in a.assigned_to
}

check repair_assert_1

pred repair_pred_1 {
    all s : Person | all a: Assignment | PolicyAllowsGrading[s, a] implies not s in a.assigned_to
}

run repair_pred_1
```
