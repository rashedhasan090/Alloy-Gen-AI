The bug in the specification is in the assertion 'repair_assert_1'. It asserts that a binary tree is sorted if and only if all elements in the right subtree of every node are greater than the node and all elements in the left subtree of every node are less than the node. However, the assertion only checks the right subtree and not the left subtree.

To fix the bug, we can modify the assertion to check both the left and right subtrees. The modified assertion is:

```
assert repair_assert_1{
  Sorted <=>
    {
      all n:Node {
          all n2: n.right.*(left + right) | n2.elem < n.elem
          all n2: n.left.*(left + right) | n2.elem < n.elem
          all n2: n.right.*(left + right) | n2.elem > n.elem
          all n2: n.left.*(left + right) | n2.elem > n.elem
        }
    }
}
```

This modified assertion checks that all elements in the left subtree of every node are less than the node, as well as all elements in the right subtree of every node are greater than the node.

After making this change, the assertion passes and the model can successfully check and run.
