The bug in the specification is in the "Sorted" predicate. The predicate's quantification over nodes does not consider the possibility of a node being the header, which can lead to missing elements during sorting.

To fix this, the "Sorted" predicate should be changed to:

pred Sorted(This: List) {
    all n: This.header.*link | n in This.header -> n.elem + (n.link - n)
}

This ensures that all elements in the list are sorted, including those in the header, by recursively checking each pair of adjacent nodes in the list.

After fixing the specification, the assertions should pass without errors.
