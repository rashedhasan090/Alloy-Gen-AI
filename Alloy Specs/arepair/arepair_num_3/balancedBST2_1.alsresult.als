The bug in this specification is in the predicate `HasAtMostOneChild(n: Node)`. It currently restricts `n.(left + right)` to be `lone`, which means `n` can have at most one child. However, this does not allow for nodes with no children, which is valid for a binary tree. 

To fix this, we can change the predicate to allow for `n.(left + right)` to be `none` as well. This can be achieved by adding `or none n.(left + right)` to the predicate. 

The correct predicate is:

```
pred HasAtMostOneChild(n: Node) {
  // Node n has at most one child.
  lone n.(left + right) or none n.(left + right)
}
```

With this change, all assertions in the specification are satisfied.
