The bug in this specification is in the "Sorted" predicate. The "n.^left" and "n.^right" expressions are used to refer to all nodes in the left and right subtrees of a node, respectively. However, these expressions include the node itself, which leads to an incorrect definition of a binary search tree. To fix this, we should replace "n.^left" with "n.left.*(left + right)" and "n.^right" with "n.right.*(left + right)" in the "Sorted" predicate.

Fixed "Sorted" predicate:

```pred Sorted() {
  all n:Node {
    // All elements in the n's left subtree are smaller than the n's elem.
    all n2:n.left.*(left + right) | n2.elem < n.elem
    // All elements in the n's right subtree are bigger than the n's elem.
    all n2:n.right.*(left + right) | n2.elem > n.elem
  }
}```

With this fix, the Alloy specification should correctly define a binary search tree.
