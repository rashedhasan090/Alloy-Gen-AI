The bug is in the ConsistentPreAndNxt predicate. Currently, it is commented out, but the fix mentioned in the comment is incorrect. The correct fix is to add the following line inside the predicate:

nxt = ~pre

This ensures that the next node of a node is the inverse of its previous node and vice versa. The fixed ConsistentPreAndNxt predicate should look like this:

pred ConsistentPreAndNxt() {
  nxt = ~pre
}

After making this change, the Alloy specification should be re-checked to ensure that all properties hold.
