The bug is in the "Contains" predicate. The predicate checks if all nodes in the list have an element equal to x, which is an overconstraint. The predicate should check if at least one node in the list has an element equal to x, which means replacing "all" with "some". The correct implementation of the predicate is:

```
pred Contains(This: List, x: Int, result: Boolean) {
    some n: This.header.*link | n.elem = x  => result = True else result = False
}
```
