The bug in this specification is that the "Loop" and "Sorted" predicates are underconstrained, meaning that there are not enough constraints to determine whether they hold or not. 

In the "Loop" predicate, there needs to be a constraint to ensure that if the list has a header, then there is at least one node in the header's link chain that loops back to itself. This can be fixed by adding the following constraint:

no This.header or one n: This.header.*link | n = n.link

In the "Sorted" predicate, there needs to be a constraint to ensure that all nodes in the list are sorted in increasing order according to their element values. This can be fixed by adding the following constraint:

all n: This.header.*link | no n.link or n.elem <= n.link.elem

Both of these fixes have been included in the comments above.
