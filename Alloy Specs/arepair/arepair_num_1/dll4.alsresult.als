The bug in this specification is in the "Sorted" predicate. Specifically, the condition "n.nxt.elem > n.elem" should be replaced with "some n.nxt => n.nxt.elem >= n.elem". The corrected predicate would be:

pred Sorted() {
  // The list is sorted in ascending order (<=) along nxt.
  all n:Node {
    some n.nxt => n.nxt.elem >= n.elem
  }
}

This change ensures that the list is truly sorted in ascending order along the nxt relationship. With the previous condition, it was possible for two adjacent nodes to have the same element value, which is not consistent with a sorted list.
