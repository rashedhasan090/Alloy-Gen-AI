The bug in the specification is that the pred PolicyAllowsGrading does not check whether the person who is grading the assignment is also assigned to that assignment. To fix this, the specification needs to add "s !in a.assigned_to" to ensure that the grader is not also assigned to the same assignment. 

The fixed specification is as follows:

abstract sig Person {}
sig Student extends Person {}
sig Professor extends Person {}
sig Class {
    assistant_for: set Student,   // as in : "is TA for"
    instructor_of: one Professor
}
sig Assignment {
    associated_with: one Class,
    assigned_to: some Student
}

pred PolicyAllowsGrading(s: Person, a: Assignment) {
    s in a.associated_with.assistant_for or s in a.associated_with.instructor_of
    s !in a.assigned_to // fixed predicate
}

assert repair_assert_1 {
    all s : Person | all a: Assignment | PolicyAllowsGrading[s, a] implies not s in a.assigned_to
}

check repair_assert_1

pred repair_pred_1 {
    all s : Person | all a: Assignment | PolicyAllowsGrading[s, a] implies not s in a.assigned_to
}

run repair_pred_1
