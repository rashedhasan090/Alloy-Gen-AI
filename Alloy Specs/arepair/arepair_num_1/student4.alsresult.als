The bug in the Sorted predicate is that it does not consider the possibility of nodes having no link, leading to an incomplete sorting constraint. To fix this, we need to add a disjunction to the quantified formula that allows nodes with no link to be included in the sorted list. 

The corrected predicate is as follows:

pred Sorted(This: List) {
  all n:(This.header.*link) | some n.link => n.elem <= n.link.elem or no n.link
}

The added condition "or no n.link" allows nodes with no link to be considered sorted.
