The bug is in the "Balanced" predicate. The predicate checks if the difference between the number of children in nodes n1 and n2 is at most 1. However, this is not sufficient for the tree to be balanced. The condition should also check if n1 and n2 have at most one child each. 

The fix is to replace "lone (#n1.(left+right) - #n2.(left+right))" with "(HasAtMostOneChild[n1] && HasAtMostOneChild[n2]) => (let diff = minus[Depth[n1], Depth[n2]] | -1 <= diff && diff <= 1)". 

The corrected version of the "Balanced" predicate is:

pred Balanced() {
  all n1, n2: Node {
    (HasAtMostOneChild[n1] && HasAtMostOneChild[n2]) => (let diff = minus[Depth[n1], Depth[n2]] | -1 <= diff && diff <= 1)
  }
}
