The bug is in the "Sorted" predicate. The condition "all n: Node | n.elem < n.nxt.elem" does not work when the list has only one node or when it is empty. To fix this, the condition should be changed to "some n.nxt implies n.elem <= n.nxt.elem". This will ensure that the condition only holds when there is at least one node following the current node.

The corrected predicate is:

pred Sorted() {
  // The list is sorted in ascending order (<=) along nxt.
  some n.nxt implies n.elem <= n.nxt.elem
}
