There is a bug in the assert statement at the end. The assert is checking that no transition ends at the start state, but this is already ensured by the ValidStartAndStop fact. 

The assert should check a different property related to the start state. For example, it could check that there exists at least one state that can reach the start state through a transition. 

Here's the fixed assert statement:
```
assert repair_assert_1{
    some s: State | FSM.start in s.*transition
}
```
