The bug in the specification is in the predicate AllExtObject(). The formula "c.*ext" means the transitive closure of the ext relation, which includes c itself. Therefore, the formula "c in c.*ext" will always be true for any class c, including Object. This means that the predicate will not check whether each class other than Object is a sub-class of Object.

To fix the bug, we need to change the formula in AllExtObject() to exclude c from the transitive closure of the ext relation. We can do this by using "c.^ext" instead of "c.*ext". However, this will still include Object in the closure, so we also need to use "Object.^~ext" to exclude Object and get the closure of all other classes.

Here is the fixed specification:

sig Class {
  ext: lone Class
}

one sig Object extends Class {}

pred ObjectNoExt() {
  // Object does not extend any class.
  // Fix: replace "c.^ext" with "c.^~ext" or "c.~^ext".
  all c: Class | Object !in c.^ext
}

pred Acyclic() {
  // No class is a sub-class of itself (transitively).
  all c: Class | c !in c.^ext
}

pred AllExtObject() {
  // Each class other than Object is a sub-class of Object.
  // Fix: replace "c.*ext" with "Object.^~ext".
  all c: Class - Object | c in Object.^~ext.^ext
}

pred ClassHierarchy() {
  ObjectNoExt
  Acyclic
  AllExtObject
}

//run ClassHierarchy for 3

assert repair_assert_1{
    ObjectNoExt <=>  all c: Class | Object !in c.~^ext
}
check repair_assert_1

pred repair_pred_1 {
    ObjectNoExt <=> all c: Class | Object !in c.~^ext
}
run repair_pred_1
