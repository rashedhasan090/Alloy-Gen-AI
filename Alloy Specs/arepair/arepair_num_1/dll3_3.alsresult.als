The bug is in the predicate ConsistentPreAndNxt, which does not have any constraints on the pre and nxt fields of the Node signature. To fix this, we need to add the constraint "nxt = ~pre" to ensure that the next node of a Node is the previous node's complement and vice versa. The fixed predicate is:

pred ConsistentPreAndNxt () {
  all n : Node { nxt [n] = ~pre [n] }
}

With this fix, the specification should work correctly.
