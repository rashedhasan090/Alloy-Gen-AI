The bug in the specification is that the antireflexive constraint is not properly implemented. The constraint only removes the reflexive edges (i.e., a node being a neighbor of itself), but it doesn't prevent nodes from having no neighbors at all. To fix this, we need to add "no lone" to the constraint. The corrected fact should be:

fact undirected {
  neighbors = ~neighbors    -- symmetric
  no iden & neighbors      -- antireflexive
  no lone Node             -- prevent nodes from having no neighbors
}

With this fix, the specification ensures that there are no reflexive edges, no isolated nodes, and that the graph is undirected.
