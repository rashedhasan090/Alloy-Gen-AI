The bug in the specification is in the "Contains" predicate. The implication operator "=>" should be replaced with the equivalence operator "<=>" to correctly express the condition that the list contains x if and only if the result is True. The fixed predicate is:

```
pred Contains(This: List, x: Int, result: Boolean) {
    RepOk[This]
    {some n: This.header.*link | n.elem = x } <=> True = result
}
```
