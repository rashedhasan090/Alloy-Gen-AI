The bug is in Part (b) of the specification where the condition "all s: State | s.transition = none => s in FSM.stop" is using the implication operator ("=>") instead of the bidirectional implication operator ("<=>"). This means that the condition is only checked for states with no outgoing transitions, but not for states with outgoing transitions. The correct condition should be "all s: State | s.transition = none <=> s in FSM.stop".

The fixed specification:

one sig FSM {
  start: set State,
  stop: set State
}

sig State {
  transition: set State
}

fact OneStartAndStop {
  all start1, start2 : FSM.start | start1 = start2

  all stop1, stop2 : FSM.stop | stop1 = stop2

  some FSM.stop
}

fact ValidStartAndStop {
  FSM.start !in FSM.stop

  all s : State | FSM.start !in s.transition

  all s: State | s.transition = none <=> s in FSM.stop
}

fact Reachability {
  State = FSM.start.*transition

  all s: State | FSM.stop in s.*transition
}

assert repair_assert_1 {
  no FSM.stop.transition
}

check repair_assert_1

pred repair_pred_1 {
  no FSM.stop.transition
}

run repair_pred_1
