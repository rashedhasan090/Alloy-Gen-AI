The bug in the specification is in the fact CardinalityConstraints. It should allow for the possibility of a List with no header, but the current fact requires all lists to have exactly one header. To fix this, we can change "lone l.header" to "no l.header". The corrected fact CardinalityConstraints should be:

fact CardinalityConstraints {
    no l: List | lone l.header
    all n: Node | lone n.link
    all n: Node | one n.elem
}
