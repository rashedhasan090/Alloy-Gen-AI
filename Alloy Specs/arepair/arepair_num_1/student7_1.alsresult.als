The bug in this specification is in the predicate "Loop". 

To fix the bug:
- In the predicate "Loop", replace "&&" with "||" in the quantification expression.
- In the same predicate, replace ">" with "=" in the cardinality constraint expression.

The corrected predicate "Loop" should be: 

pred Loop(This: List) {
    one n: This.header.*link | n = n.link
    #header <= 1
}

Note that this fixes the overconstraint and underconstraint mentioned in the comments of the predicate.
