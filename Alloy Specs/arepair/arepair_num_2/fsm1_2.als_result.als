The bug in this specification is that it does not enforce the constraint that there should always be at least one stop state. To fix this, we can add a fact that states that there exists at least one state that is a stop state.

The fixed specification is:

```
one sig FSM {
  start: set State,
  stop: set State
}

sig State {
  transition: set State
}

fact OneStartAndStop {
  all start1, start2 : FSM.start | start1 = start2
  all stop1, stop2 : FSM.stop | stop1 = stop2

  some FSM.stop // Enforce there is at least one stop state.
}

fact ValidStartAndStop {
  FSM.start !in FSM.stop
  all s: State | s.transition !in FSM.start
  all s: State | s.transition = none <=> s in FSM.stop
}

fact Reachability {
  State = FSM.start.*transition
  all s: State | FSM.stop in s.*transition
}

assert repair_assert_1{
    some FSM.start.transition
}

check repair_assert_1

pred repair_pred_1{
    no FSM.stop.transition
}

run repair_pred_1
```
