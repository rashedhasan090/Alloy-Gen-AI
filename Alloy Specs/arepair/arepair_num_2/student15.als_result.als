The bug is in the Sorted predicate. The current implementation requires that all nodes in the list satisfy the condition that their element is less than their linked node's element. This over-constrains the list since it doesn't allow for nodes that have no linked node (i.e. last node in the list). To fix this bug, we need to modify the predicate as follows:

```
pred Sorted(This: List) {
    all n : This.header.*link |
        (n.link in n.^link => n.elem < n.link.elem)
}
```

This implementation only checks the element order if the node has a linked node, otherwise, it doesn't apply the constraint. With this fix, the assertions should hold.
