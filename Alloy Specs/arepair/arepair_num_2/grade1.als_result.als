The bug in the specification is that the predicate PolicyAllowsGrading is not defining properly what is the type of s. To fix this, we need to add a disjunction between the different subtypes of Person. The fixed specification is as follows:

```
abstract sig Person {}
sig Student extends Person {}
sig Professor extends Person {}
sig Class {
    assistant_for: set Student,   // as in : "is TA for"
    instructor_of: one Professor
}
sig Assignment {
    associated_with: one Class,
    assigned_to: some Student
}

pred PolicyAllowsGrading(s: Person, a: Assignment) {
    s in a.associated_with.assistant_for or s = a.associated_with.instructor_of
}

assert repair_assert_1 {
    all s: Person | all a: Assignment | PolicyAllowsGrading[s, a] implies not s in a.assigned_to
}

check repair_assert_1

pred repair_pred_1 {
    all s: Person | all a: Assignment | PolicyAllowsGrading[s, a] implies not s in a.assigned_to
}

run repair_pred_1
```
