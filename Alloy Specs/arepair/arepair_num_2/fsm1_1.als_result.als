The bug is in Part (b) of the specification. The condition "all s: State | s.transition = none => s in FSM.stop" is incorrect because it allows for states to be both start and stop states if they have no transitions. To fix this, replace the condition with "all s: State - FSM.stop | s.transition != none", which means that all states except the stop state must have transitions.

The corrected Part (b) is as follows:

```
// Part (b)
fact ValidStartAndStop {
  // A state cannot be both a start state and a stop state.
  FSM.start !in FSM.stop

  // No transition ends at the start state.
  all s : State | FSM.start !in s.transition
  // All states that have transitions are not stop states.
  all s: State - FSM.stop | s.transition != none
}
```
