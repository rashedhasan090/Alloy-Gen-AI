The bug in the specification is in the Sorted predicate. The predicate currently states that all nodes in the list have an element that is less than or equal to the element of the node it links to. However, this should only apply if the node has a link (i.e., it is not the last node in the list). To fix this, we need to add a condition to check if the node has a link before applying the constraint. 

Here is the corrected `Sorted` predicate:

```
// Corrected.
pred Sorted(This: List) {
    all n: This.header.*link | (no n.link) or (n.elem <= n.link.elem)
}
```

This ensures that the constraint only applies to nodes with links, while allowing the last node in the list to have any element. With this correction applied, the `repair_assert_2` assertion and the `repair_pred_2` predicate should hold.
