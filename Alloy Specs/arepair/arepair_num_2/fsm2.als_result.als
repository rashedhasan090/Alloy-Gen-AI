The bug is in the ValidStartAndStop fact where the constraint all s:State | FSM.start != s.transition is preventing any state from having a transition that leads to the start state, which is incorrect. The constraint should be updated to allow transitions leading to the start state but disallow transitions starting at the start state.

The fixed ValidStartAndStop fact is:

fact ValidStartAndStop {
  // A state cannot be both a start state and a stop state.
  FSM.start != FSM.stop
  // No transition begins at the start state.
  no FSM.start.transition
  // No transition ends at the stop state.
  no FSM.transition.stop
}
