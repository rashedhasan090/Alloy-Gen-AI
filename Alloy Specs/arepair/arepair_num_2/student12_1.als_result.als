The bug in the specification is in the 'Contains' predicate. The '=>' operator should be replaced with '=>' and '&', like this: 

```
// Fixed
pred Contains(This: List, x: Int, result: Boolean) {
    RepOk[This]
    result = (some n: This.header.*link | n.elem = x) => True else False
}
```

This ensures that the result is True as long as there exists a node with the given element, otherwise it is False.
