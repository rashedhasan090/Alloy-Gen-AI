The bug in this specification is in the fact Reachable. The correct fact should be:

```
fact Reachable {
    Node = BinaryTree.root.*left + BinaryTree.root.*right
}
```

Note that the union operator "+" has been replaced with the intersection operator "*" in the right-hand side of the equation.

The original fact would only ensure that all nodes reachable from the root via the left or right nodes are in the tree, but it would not guarantee that all nodes in the tree are reachable from the root. The corrected fact ensures that all nodes in the tree are reachable from the root through either the left or right nodes.
