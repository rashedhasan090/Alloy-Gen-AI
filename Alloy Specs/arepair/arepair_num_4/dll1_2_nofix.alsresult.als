The bug in the specification is in the "Sorted" predicate. The comparison should be "<" instead of "<=" to ensure that the list is strictly ascending. 

The corrected "Sorted" predicate is:

```
pred Sorted() {
  // The list is sorted in ascending order (<) along nxt.
  all n : Node | n.elem < n.nxt.elem
}
```
