The bug in this specification is in the "Sorted" predicate. 

The correct version of this predicate is:

```alloy
pred Sorted(This: List) {
    all l : This.header.*link | all n : l.link | l.elem <= n.elem
}
```

Explanation: In the original predicate, "n.link" is used instead of "l.link", which causes an error because "n" is a local variable and is not defined within the context of the outer quantifier that defines "l". Additionally, the original predicate does not ensure the entire list is sorted, since elements in separate link chains can be sorted independently. The corrected predicate ensures that all elements in all link chains are sorted relative to each other.
