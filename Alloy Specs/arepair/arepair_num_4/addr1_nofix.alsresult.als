The bug in this specification is in the assertion 'repair_assert_1'. It asserts that for every book and for every name in that book's entry, there exists at least one address in the result of 'lookup[b,n]'. However, this does not guarantee that there is at least one address in the book's entry. To fix this bug, the assertion should be modified as follows: 

assert repair_assert_1 {
  all b: Book | some a: Address | a in b.entry
}

This assertion checks that for every book, there exists at least one address in its entry.
