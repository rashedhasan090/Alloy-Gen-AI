The bug is in the fact IGNORE. It specifies that List.header is linked with all nodes in Node, which contradicts the fact CardinalityConstraints that states that List should have only one header. 

To fix the bug, we need to change List.header.*link = Node to List.header = Node. This way, we ensure that List has only one header node, which is linked with all other nodes in the set Node. 

The corrected fact IGNORE is as follows:

fact IGNORE {
  one List
  List.header = Node
}
