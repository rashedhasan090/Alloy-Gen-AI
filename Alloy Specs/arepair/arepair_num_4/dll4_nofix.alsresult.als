The bug in this specification is in Part (c) where it states that "The list is sorted in ascending order (<=) along nxt." It should instead state that "The list is sorted in ascending order (<=) along elem." To fix this bug, the code in Part (c) should be changed as follows:

// Part (c)
pred Sorted() {
  // The list is sorted in ascending order (<=) along elem.
  all n:Node | n.nxt.elem >= n.elem
}
