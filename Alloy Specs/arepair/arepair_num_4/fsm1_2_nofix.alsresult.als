The bug in the specification is in the assertion "repair_assert_1". It is checking that there is no transition from the stop state, but this is not a valid property of a finite state machine. A valid property would be to check that there is at least one transition from the start state. 

To fix the bug, the assertion should be changed to:

assert repair_assert_1{
    some FSM.start.transition
}

This checks that there is at least one transition from the start state.
