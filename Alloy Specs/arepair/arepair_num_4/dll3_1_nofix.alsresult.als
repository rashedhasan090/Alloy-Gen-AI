The bug is in the ConsistentPreAndNxt predicate. The predicate is commented out and not implemented correctly. The correct implementation should be:

pred ConsistentPreAndNxt() {
  all n1, n2: Node {
    n1.nxt = n2 implies n2.pre = n1 and n1 = n2.pre
  }
}

The predicate ensures that if node n2 follows node n1 in the list, then n2's previous node is n1 and vice versa. This fixes the bug and ensures the integrity of the doubly linked list structure.
