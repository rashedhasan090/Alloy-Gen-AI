The bug in the specification is in the Depth function. The current definition of the Depth function computes the number of nodes in the tree from the root to the given node by subtracting the number of nodes in the given node's left and right sub-trees from the total number of nodes in the tree. However, this computation does not take into account the root node itself.

To fix the bug, we need to add one to the result of the current computation. The corrected definition of the Depth function is:

fun Depth(n: Node): one Int {
  // The number of nodes from the tree's root to n.
  (#BinaryTree.root.*(left+right))-(#n.(left+right))+1
}

This definition adds one to the result of the original computation, which correctly includes the root node in the count.
