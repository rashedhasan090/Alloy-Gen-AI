The bug in the specification is in the predicate "Sorted". The condition should be "n.nxt.elem >= n.elem" instead of "n.nxt.elem > n.elem". This is because the list is sorted in ascending order (<=), so the next element must be greater than or equal to the current element.

The corrected predicate "Sorted" is as follows:

// Part (c)
pred Sorted() {
  // The list is sorted in ascending order (<=) along nxt.
  all n:Node {
    n.nxt.elem >= n.elem
  }
}

With this fix, the assertions are now satisfied.
