The bug in this specification is in the 'fact Reachable' assertion. The correct assertion should be:

fact Reachable {
    Node = BinaryTree.root.*(left + right)
}

This asserts that all nodes in the tree are reachable from the root node through a path of left and right nodes. The '*' operator represents transitive closure, while the '+' operator represents transitive reflexive closure.
