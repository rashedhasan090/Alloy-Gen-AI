The bug in the specification is that it does not enforce that every state has at least one transition. This can cause the assertion "no FSM.stop.transition" to fail.

To fix the bug, add a constraint that every state has at least one transition:

modifying code:

fact ValidStartAndStop {
  // A state cannot be both a start state and a stop state.
  FSM.start !in FSM.stop

  // No transition ends at the start state.
  all s : State | FSM.start !in s.transition

  // Every state has at least one transition.
  all s : State | s.transition != none

  // If no transition then stop state.
  all s: State | s.transition = none => s in FSM.stop
}

After the modification, the assertion "no FSM.stop.transition" will always hold.
