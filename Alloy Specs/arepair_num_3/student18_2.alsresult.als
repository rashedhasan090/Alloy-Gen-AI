The bug in the specification is in the "Loop" predicate. It allows for a List to have a header with no link, and it also allows for a header with multiple links. This means that the predicate does not correctly capture the requirement that a List must be a single linked loop. To fix the bug, the "Loop" predicate should be:

```
pred Loop(This: List) {
    lone This.header
    all n: Node - This.header | one m: n.*link & m = This.header
}
```

This predicate ensures that a List can only have one header, and that all nodes except the header must have exactly one link that points to a node, which itself eventually points back to the header to form a loop. 

After making this change, the assertions should all pass.
