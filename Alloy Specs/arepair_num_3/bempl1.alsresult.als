The bug in the specification is that the Key sig does not specify that it can only be authorized by a Researcher, allowing an Employee to authorize a key for themselves. The bug can be fixed by adding a constraint that specifies that only Researchers can authorize keys.

The fixed Alloy specification is as follows:

/*
Further simplification of Dan's work
access is granted to all assigned groups.
*/

//rooms
sig Room {}

one sig secure_lab extends Room {}

//people
abstract sig Person {
  owns : set Key
}

sig Employee extends Person {}

sig Researcher extends Person {}

// access
sig Key {
  authorized: one Researcher, // only researchers can authorize keys
  opened_by: one Room
}

pred CanEnter(p: Person, r:Room) {
  r in p.owns.opened_by
}

// assertion
assert repair_assert_1 {
  all p : Person | CanEnter[p, secure_lab] implies p in Researcher
}

check repair_assert_1

pred repair_pred_1{
 some opened_by
 some owns
 all p : Person | CanEnter[p, secure_lab] implies p in Researcher
}

run repair_pred_1

With this constraint added, the CanEnter predicate ensures that only Researcher can enter the secure_lab, thus satisfying the assertion.
