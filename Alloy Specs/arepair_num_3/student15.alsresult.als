The bug is in the Sorted predicate, which has an overconstraint. It should allow nodes to have no link. To fix the bug, we can modify the Sorted predicate as follows:

```
pred Sorted(This: List) {
    all n : This.header.*link |
        no n.link or n.elem < n.link.elem
}
```

This modification allows nodes to not have a link, while preserving the requirement that if a node has a link, its element should be strictly less than the element of the linked node. With this modification, the specification satisfies the given assertions.
